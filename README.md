Simple project for me to pick up flutter, been playing a lot of pokemon recently. Will use the graphql api, figma to flutter design tool.


Using dhiwise. Publish build


com.example.pokedex (swap name later)

```flutter

Going to publish this app to the play store, main purpose is to try to cash out my google play rewards.
